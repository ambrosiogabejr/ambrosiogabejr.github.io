              <p class='article'>We must create a culture of zone focused revenue, this will take a collaborative effort with
                                  Research/BI/Marketing/Sales and Interactive to come up with a clean, concise story. What does this do?
                                  It gets AE buy-in. General Market Sales will be integrated into a new local/zone focus culture. Buy-in
                                  into the zone strategy will create many more new business opportunities.</p>

              <p class='articleList'>We will need to create a zone revenue target with AE ownership. Accountability reports will be set up by
                                    BI based on zone history billing. Then we will come up with zone metrics to be met by the AEs in their zone home.</p>
              <p class='articleList'>More new business = More volume = number of zone clients = more new revenue. Our goal is to lift AEs to 25 to 30 accounts
